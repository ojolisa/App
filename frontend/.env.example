# Frontend environment variables (Vite)
# Copy this file to `.env.local` and adjust as needed. Variables must start with VITE_ to be exposed to the client.

# If set, the app will call this backend directly, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:4000/predict
# Leave unset during local dev to use Vite's proxy (see vite.config.js) by calling "/api" instead.
